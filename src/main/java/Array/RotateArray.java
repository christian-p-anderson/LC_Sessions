/*
    This approach is based on the fact that when we rotate the array k times, k%nk elements from the back end of the
    array come to the front and the rest of the elements from the front shift backwards.

    In this approach, we firstly reverse all the elements of the array. Then, reversing the first k elements followed
    by reversing the rest n-knâˆ’k elements gives us the required result.

    Let n = 7n=7 and k = 3k=3.

    Original List                   : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    After reversing all numbers     : 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
    After reversing first k numbers : 5 6 7 4 3 2 1
    After revering last n-k numbers : 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 --> Result
